Audience: People interested in agriculure who are not familiar 
Hello all, my name is Nadia and I love agriculture. I grew up on a small beef farm, participated in the National FFA Organization, and studied agriculture in college. Over my time in agriculture, I have seen a common, and unfortanete problem: majority of the public does not understand agriculture. In today's society, it seems as if people are more than ever removed from where their food comes from. If you ask people where their food comes from, they more often than not say the grocery store. The grovery store is the place where most consumers come in contact with their food, it is important for people to be aware of where and how their food is grown. A recent survey reported by Ciston PR Newswire suggests that 72% of Americans know little to nothing about farming and where their food comes from. Throughout agriculture classes. we are taught that less than 2% of the population direfctly work with production agriculture. This disconnect has created multiple misconceptions that people have about agriculture. To many, agriclture is an outdated practice
